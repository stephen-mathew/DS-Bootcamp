**Q1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?**

Ans: _Functions are reusable. Since these are modular, the same code can be called with different inputs without having to write the code again, and it can be accessed from another python file also._ 

- - - 

**Q2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?**

Ans: _It runs only when it is called._ 

- - - 

**Q3. What statement creates a function?**

Ans: _The `def` keyword is used to specify/define a code block is a function._ 

- - - 

**Q4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?**

Ans: _A function is the definition of the function which may include the parameter variables only, whereas a function call specifies the parameter values to be used when the function code is run._ 

- - - 

**Q5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?**

Ans: _ _ 

- - - 

**Q6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?**

Ans: _These variables will not be in the execution stack and hence the values held by these variables will be overwritten._ 

- - - 

**Q7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?**

Ans: _A return value is sent from a function's execution to the line of code that called the function. Yes, it is possible to have an expression in the return statement, such as a function call._ 

- - - 

**Q8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?**

Ans: _None_ 

- - - 

**Q9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?**

Ans: _Displaying or reading a global variable in a function can be done as with normal variables. To assign or write values to the global variable from within a function, the global variable needs to be declared using the `global` keyword within the function._ 

- - - 

**Q10. What is the data type of None?**

Ans: _NoneType_ 

- - - 

**Q11. What does the sentence `import areallyourpetsnamederic` do?**

Ans: _This statement imports all the variables and methods of the `areallyourpetsnamederic` module or package into your python file. _ 

- - - 

**Q12. If you had a `bacon()` feature in a `spam` module, what would you call it after importing `spam`?**

Ans: _spam.bacon()_ 

- - - 

**Q13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?**

Ans: _We can use exception handling using `try` and `except` blocks._ 

- - - 

**Q14. What is the purpose of the `try` clause? What is the purpose of the `except` clause?**

Ans: _A `try` code block is associated with a following `except` code block. If  code that is contained in a `try` block throws an exception, that exception can be handled using custom code from with an `except` code block._
